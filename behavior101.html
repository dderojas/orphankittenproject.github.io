            <h2 class="major">Socialization</h2>
						<p>
              Kittens prime socialization period is between 3-8 weeks of age. This is prime time to expose your
              kitten to as many new people and scenarios as possible. However,
              kittens are not fully vaccinated at this time so should only interact with other kittens
              that have had at least one vaccine, fully vaccinated adult animals, and people that
              have washed their hands.

            <h2 class="major">Feeding</h2>
						<p>
              Most kittens start out eating wet food, and transition to dry at about 6 weeks of age.
              Encouraging our kittens to eat meals rather than free feeding helps us to monitor
              their appetite and reduce the chance of obesity. Kittens have a fast metabolism, so
              make sure to provide them with a high calorie density food (usually labeled for
              kittens) and give them three meals a day while they are growing. Meals also provide
              us with an opportunity to introduce food toys, which can give the kittens mental
              exercise as they try to figure it out! Here’s a link to make some food toys on your
              own: <br />

            <h2 class="major">Play</h2>

						<p>
              Kittens are naturally energetic, and will want to play with their human family
              members. It is important to teach them that human body parts are not toys, while
              not punishing the natural play behavior. Avoid playing with your hands, feet or hair
              with your kittens. It may seem cute now, but as they get older it can lead to harm to
              the owners that can lead to rehoming the kittens or worse. Instead, when a kitten
              comes to you looking to play, offer the kittens toys that they can kick. Some
              examples include the Kong Kickeroo or the Yeowww! Banana. In addition, a great
              way to play with kittens is with wand toys. These teach kittens appropriate play
              behavior. Kittens have a lot of energy, so make sure to have plenty of toys available
              for them and engage in at least 30 minutes of active play with them per day.

            <h2 class="major">Inside vs Outside</h2>
						<p>
              While it is tempting to let our kittens outside, research shows that cats that live
              indoors only will live 2-3 years longer than those that live outdoors. They are
              protected from wildlife, dogs, and accidental deaths by being kept indoors. If your
              kitty is interested in exploring the outside world, we recommend training them to
              wear a harness for supervised outdoor time or, if you are really ambitious, building
              a catio! Environmental stimulation is extra important for indoor only cats to keep
              them happy and healthy and to protect against various behavioral and health
              concerns. Active play time as well as numerous toys, scratching posts, and places to
              hide are crucial for their mental and physical health.
						</p>

            <h2 class="major">Scratching</h2>
						<p>
              Scratching is a natural social behavior of cats, but can become a problem for owners.
              We want our kitties to have appropriate opportunities to express this behavior, so
              having multiple scratching objects around high valued resources such as food bowls
              or resting spots will reduce a kittens need to scratch on other furniture. If your
              kitten is scratching on furniture, don’t punish them! Using a spray bottle or yelling
              only causes stress and fear in your kitten, and won’t fix the underlying cause of the
              problem. Instead, make the behavior unrewarding by covering the scratched area in
              an undesirable texture, such as aluminum foil or double sided tape.
